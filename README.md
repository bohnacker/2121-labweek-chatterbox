Examples and stuff for the Labweek at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd

---

## Using the examples

The examples will only work with a server like this:
https://github.com/bohnacker/simple-server

To make the examples working you need to create the file `base-url.js` in the folder of the example you want to run. This javascript file just consists of this line:

``` javascript
const baseURL="https://some.server.url/";   
```

Replace `some.server.url` with your server!

## Server communication

In the examples we're using jQuery to post and get messages. 

### Posting messages

You can post messages to the serve in the form `https://some.server.url/my-channel?message=hello`. With jQuery this could be done this way:

```javascript
let channel = "my-channel";
let message = "hello";
let submitURL = baseURL + channel + '?' + $.param({ message: message });

// send the data to the server. 
$.post(submitURL, function () {
  // this function will be called on success
});
``` 

All messages will be given a unique id and a timestamp by the server.

### Getting messages

These messages get stored by channel in a simple json database and can be retreived with get commands like `https://some.server.url/my-channel`.

```javascript
let channel = "my-channel";

// get messages from the server
$.get(baseURL + channel, function (messages) {
  // messages is an array of all the messages in that channel
  console.log(messages);
});
```

If you only need new messages since a certain timestamp: 
`https://some.server.url/my-channel?since=123456789`.

```javascript
let lastMessageTime = 123456789;

$.get(baseURL + "my-channel?since=" + lastMessageTime, function (messages) {
  // messages will contain all messages newer than the given timestamp
  console.log(messages);
});
```

You can also request messages matching certain key value pairs: 
`https://some.server.url/my-channel?index=13` will send you all messages in the channel `my-channel` where the value of the property index is 13. In the script it will look like this:

```javascript
let channel = "my-channel";
$.get(baseURL + channel + '?' + $.param({ index: 13 }), function (messages) {
  // messages will contain all messages newer than the given timestamp
  console.log(messages);
});
```

### Deleting messages

To delete messages you can either delete all messages from one channel...

```javascript
$.get(baseURL + "my-channel/clear");
```

... or delete messages that fit specific key/value pairs. The following will delete all messages with the id "abcde" in the channel "my-channel":

```javascript
let channel = "my-channel";
let submitURL = baseURL + channel + '/delete?' + $.param({ id: "abcde" });
$.get(submitURL);
```
